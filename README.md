# Vampires

Now this Civ is a fairly simple one, altough their use can get complex. All their heal a bit even if they move, but are overall more expensive and weak on desert, that means they are good at banking units through the eras and have them keep their promotions. Their armies are a bit slow to expand in the early game but their Dracula Castle(replacement for castle) boosts production back to normal.

Their Daywalkers can convert other units and heals if they defeat others, and this promotion sticks even if you upgrade them later. There's a fairly short window of time for getting them though so make sure you don't miss them. Hope you enjoy.
